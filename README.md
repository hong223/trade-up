<h2><a name = "Title1"> 1.Project Overview </a></h2>

[Trade Up](http://www.trade-up.com.au/) is a software company that aims to solve the inefficiency of the labour usage in Australian construction companies. The cost of employment as well as the cost of materials are consistent amongst subcontractors due to industrial relations and working conditions such as weather. Thus, it is vital to point out the amount of workers working on particular jobs in terms of economic terms. This will help to carry out work using the least amount of money.

**Client's Vision**
Automate current default values associated with productivity of construction companies with existing and future data. 

**Project Value**
Provide a user friendly platform that can calculate employees' productivity, roster and allocate employees, and generate smart decisions with users' data within the context of productivity.

- Trade-Up clients including subcontractors are able to visualise the project work productivity instead of using paper & pen.
- Subcontractors will be able to transition from collecting and tracking employees' workflow online instead of paper & pen approach.
- Trade-Up will have the ability to transfer created calendar and resource estaimte algorithms to their other features.  
- Rostering system that can allocate employees to each project .

<h3> 2.2 Evidence of Decision Making</h3>
The team have engaged well in the planning and reporting process outlined by us at the beginning of the project. Every team members were involved in decision making and project planning. The team appear to be communicating well between themselves and are committed to achieving a customer product feature by the end of the semester. We have created a Decision Making Trace File to record all the decisions made either with our client or during group meeting since the beginning of the semester.

- We have meeting with clients and discuss what we did and what we are going to do. If anyone have more questions, they can organise individual meeting time with the client. Then team members and client will create tasks on JIRA. We assign tasks on JIRA and members will work together on some related tasks.

- Team communication have been transitioned from Facebook to Slack where team have the opportunity to communicate with internal team members, client, tutor, and shadow team within one platform. 

<h3> 2.5 Development Approach </h3>
- The development approach we adapt is agile methodology. We hold weekly Saturday meetings consists of Scrum. The time of our weekly Scrum meeting is from 2pm - 3pm every Saturday at the provided workspace by Trade Up. 

- Each team member answers 3 following questions: 
 1. "What they have done?"
 2. "What were struggles and challenges encountered?"
 3. "What will they be doing next?"

- When a new sprint starts, each task will be distributed among each team member from JIRA assigned by client and/or the team itself. 

- Each sprint will last 2 weeks, where each member will work on the allocated task individually during the week and during team weekly meeting we come together and work on unresolved or difficulty tasks as a team.

<h3> 2.6 Engagement With Stakeholders </h3>
- We have individual meetings and chats with client whenever any of us have questions (phone, video chat, meet in office)

- We have regular client meeting from 2pm - 3pm every Saturday.

- During our 1-hour client meeting, we ask client questions and update client the progress of our project.
