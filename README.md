<h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW<h2>
https://github.com/hong223/trade-up/wiki
<br>

<h2><a name = "Title1"> 1. Value Delivered to the Client </a></h2>


1. Subcontractors can track project progress and make adjustments for workers to maximise productivity. 

2. Subcontractors are able to forecast work completion date including contract/work completion days, and contract start and end date.

3. Human errors for each construction project can be predicted for each project site.

4. A user-friendly interface for Trade-Up clients have been created to allow easy navigation through tracking each construction project.

5. Trade-Up clients including subcontractors are able to visualise their project using the implemented calendar instead of predicting resources and dates on paper.

6. Trade-Up have now have the ability to transfer created calendar and resource estaimte algorithms to their other features.  

7. Create a rostering system that can allocate employees to each project 

8. connect rostering system with project calendar

9. Display allocation on the project calendar per employee, enable re-allocation of employee to different project if needed


<h2><a name = "Title2"> 2. Project Governance </a></h2>

## 2.1 Milestones ##
Milestone 1: Project Calendar

Sprint 1 (Week 3 - Week 4) : Research, look at Angular tutorials, and find similar rostering examples. Roster UI design.

Sprint 2 (Week 5 - Week 6): Start development for project calendar features.

Milestone 2: Employee Rostering

Sprint 3 (Week 7 - Week 8): Link employee availability to the project calendar.

Sprint 4 (Week 9 - Week 10) : Set up final version of development & prepare for poster showcase.


## 2.2 Evidence of Decision Making ##
The team have engaged well in the planning and reporting process outlined by us at the beginning of the project. Every team members were involved in decision making and project planning. The team appear to be communicating well between themselves and are committed to achieving a customer product feature by the end of the semester. We have created a Decision Making Trace File to record all the decisions made either with our client or during group meeting since the beginning of the semester.

<p align="center" vertical-align="middle"><b> Team </b></p>

- We have meeting with clients and discuss what we did and what we are going to do. If anyone have more questions, they can organise individual meeting time with the client. Then team members and client will create tasks on JIRA. We assign tasks on JIRA and members will work together on some related tasks. For example, Sprint 4 and the on-going Sprint 5, tasks were created by the team and the client together. Tasks were allocated to each team member, whereas each member picked the task(s) they wanted to do, and remaining unpicked tasks were allocated by team lead. 

- Team communication have been transitioned from Facebook to Slack where team have the opportunity to communicate with internal team members, client, tutor, and shadow team within one platform. 

## 2.5 Development Approach ##
- The development approach we adapt is agile methodology. We hold weekly sunday meetings consists of Scrum. The time of our weekly Scrum meeting is from 1pm - 5pm every Sunday. 

- Each team member answers 3 following questions: 
 1. "What they have done?"
 2. "What were struggles and challenges encountered?"
 3. "What will they be doing next?"

- When a new sprint starts, each task will be distributed among each team member from JIRA assigned by client and/or the team itself. 

- Each sprint will last 2 weeks, where each member will work on the allocated task individually during the week and during team weekly meeting we come together and work on unresolved or difficulty tasks as a team.

## 2.6 Engagement With Stakeholders ##
- We have individual meetings and chats with client whenever any of us have questions (phone, video chat, meet in office)

- We have regular client meeting from 2pm - 3pm every Saturday.

- During our 1-hour client meeting, we ask client questions and update client the progress of our project.

## 2.7 Professional Team Attitude ##
- We are always in contact with our client. 

- We dress professional casual during our client meeting. 

- We follow requirements and keep everything in confidentially as per.
