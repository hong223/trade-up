<h2><a name = "Title1"> 1. Value Delivered to the Client </a></h2>

*Subcontractors are referred as to Trade-Up's clients*

1. Subcontractors can track project progress and make adjustments for workers to maximise productivity. 

2. Subcontractors are able to forecast work completion date including contract/work completion days, and contract start and end date.

3. Human errors for each construction project can be predicted for each project site.

4. A user-friendly interface for Trade-Up clients have been created to allow easy navigation through tracking each construction project.

5. Trade-Up clients including subcontractors are able to visualise their project using the implemented calendar instead of predicting resources and dates on paper.

6. Trade-Up have now have the ability to transfer created calendar and resource estaimte algorithms to their other features.  

Below chart shows 35/41 issues in Sprint 4 which have all been completed - with the remaining tasks left under the Trade-Up employed team.

## Evidence of Decision Making ##
The team have engaged well in the planning and reporting process outlined by us at the beginning of the project. Every team members were involved in decision making and project planning. The team appear to be communicating well between themselves and are committed to achieving a customer product feature by the end of the semester. We have created a Decision Making Trace File to record all the decisions made either with our client or during group meeting since the beginning of the semester.

### Development Approach ###
- The development approach we adapt is agile methodology. We hold weekly sunday meetings consists of Scrum. The time of our weekly Scrum meeting is from 1pm - 5pm every Sunday. 

- Each team member answers 3 following questions: 
 1. "What they have done?"
 2. "What were struggles and challenges encountered?"
 3. "What will they be doing next?"

- When a new sprint starts, each task will be distributed among each team member from JIRA assigned by client and/or the team itself. 

- Each sprint will last 2 weeks, where each member will work on the allocated task individually during the week and during team weekly meeting we come together and work on unresolved or difficulty tasks as a team.

### Engagement With Stakeholders ###
- We have individual meetings and chats with client whenever any of us have questions (phone, video chat, meet in office)

- We have regular client meeting from 7pm - 9pm every fortnight on Wednesday.

- During our 2-hour client meeting, we ask client questions and update client the progress of our project.

### Professional Team Attitude ###
- We are always in contact with our client. 

- We dress professional casual during our client meeting. 

- We follow requirements and keep everything in confidentially as per.

### Team Collaboration ###
- We have meeting with clients and discuss what we did and what we are going to do. If anyone have more questions, they can organise individual meeting time with the client. Then team members and client will create tasks on JIRA. We assign tasks on JIRA and members will work together on some related tasks. For example, Sprint 4 and the on-going Sprint 5, tasks were created by the team and the client together. Tasks were allocated to each team member, whereas each member picked the task(s) they wanted to do, and remaining unpicked tasks were allocated by team lead. 

- Team communication have been transitioned from Facebook to Slack where team have the opportunity to communicate with internal team members, client, tutor, and shadow team within one platform.

<h3>Sprint 5 - Preparing for the Next Stage of the Project</h3>
With the completion of the company and project calendars within our own prototyping environment, we have now been in the process of integrating these features into their existing codebase, to be deployed into production. At the same time, we are now ready to proceed with the next Agile "Epic" - the allocation of specific employees to projects based on the project calendar we have made. This will be the focus of our next sprint in the following semester, however the development workflow will be different going forward in that we will be working within their existing main repository (branching as necessary).  


This will involve setting up a development environment for each member of the Techlauncher team that will allow them to develop for the main Trade Up system. This includes configuring a MySQL database, populating it with the necessary development test data, as well has making sure various dependencies are correctly installed with the appropriate version. 


Furthermore, we will now have to acquaint ourselves with the system architecture of a mature codebase, as well as becoming familiar with Angular and any other development practices that Trade Up uses as part of their developer and operations workflows. It is our intention that much of this will be completed within the current sprint and over the summer break, so that when we begin the next semester, we are in a prime position to be immediately productive.

<h2><a name = "Title5"> 5. Project Outputs </a></h2>





## Technical Depth of Outputs: ##

- We spend lots of time figure out all the units and meanings of the construction variables. We spend lots of time and effort to calculate each dependencies and make sure we understand all the calculation and algorithms. Although it was a time consuming job and require lots of calculation and formula, now we have a full, deep and clear understanding of our customers’ website and how they operate. This will provide great benefit for future development.
- github has some weird merge conflict during commit push and pull. There are randomly appeared files that cannot be git ignored or deleted.
- React has its formal standard format for coding which makes it hard to write as we need to strictly follow the format.
- Issues with Grails tooling on particular operating systems impeding developer productivity.
- Gradle cached build dependencies that caused permission errors when committing to Git.
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing issues because the frontend is based on Webpack Dev Server which is a server separate to the Grails server and runs on a different port.

## Technical Breadth of Outputs: ##

We tried and used different tools in order to optimise our output
- React for front end development
- Mysql for database
- Excel for mock-up for algorithms
- Grails for back-end
- Jest for testing
- SASS preprocessing
- Webpack for module bundling, minification and optimisation
- Babel transpilation
- JIRA for agile project management
- Doodle for organising meeting
- Slack for communication
- Github for Landing Page
- Google Drive for file/notes sharing
